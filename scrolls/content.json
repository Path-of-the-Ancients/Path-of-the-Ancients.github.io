Her exposure to a Void shard during a sandstorm transformed her into a Veilbound, leaving her with erratic and destructive powers tied to her exposed, Void-imbued heart.

During this era, humanity discovered the Void, mistaking it for the totality of the primal force, unaware it was merely the Storm's shadow. This discovery led to a technological revolution marked by neural dampeners for emotional control, Void-powered infrastructure, and consciousness manipulation technology. The Ancients developed sophisticated systems for emotional regulation, creating a society that valued control and order above all else. Their hubris in attempting to master and suppress the natural forces of creation would ultimately lead to their downfall, as their experiments and manipulations of the fundamental forces of existence triggered the cataclysmic event known as the Shattering."

His transformation into a fundamental force of nature was mirrored by the Veil's own metamorphosis into the embodiment of Void energy. The conflict between these two forces tore reality apart, creating the foundation for modern Storm and Void manipulation. The era ended with their mutual transformation, establishing the first true understanding of balance between creation and destruction."

Modern factions like the Storm Weavers, Monks of the Eye, and Void Seekers each found new purpose under the Sentinels' guidance, leading to unprecedented cooperation between different approaches to wielding the forces.

The era saw the establishment of specialized training grounds where the Wills and their apprentices developed new techniques of Harmonic Wielding, pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible with Storm energy. The Wanderer and the Enchantress, eternal beings from the Ancient past, joined the Sentinels in mentoring this new generation, helping them understand the delicate balance between power and responsibility.

These corrupted wielders, calling themselves the Shadow Weavers, sought to pervert the balance between Storm and Void, using their understanding of the Eye's principles to amplify their destructive power. The era became defined by the struggle between the Wills and their apprentices against these dark forces, as both sides sought to prove their vision of balance. The Dancing Lights phenomenon in the Stormpeaks intensified, reflecting the growing tension between these opposing forces.

Their sacrifice, however, brought about a deeper understanding of the Storm's true nature and purpose. The Wills of the Storm, tempered by loss and battle, now stand as the world's new guardians, carrying forward the wisdom of their fallen mentors while forging their own path. This period is marked by both celebration of victory and remembrance of those lost, as the world begins to heal from the wounds of conflict. The surviving Sentinels, though diminished in number, continue to share their knowledge with the new generation, ensuring that the lessons of the past are not forgotten. It is a time of rebuilding, not just of places and things, but of hope and purpose, as the Wills work to honor the legacy of their predecessors while guiding the world toward a new understanding of balance."
