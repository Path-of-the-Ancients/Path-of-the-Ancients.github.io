Her exposure to a Void shard during a sandstorm transformed her into a Veilbound, leaving her with erratic and destructive powers tied to her exposed, Void-imbued heart.

During this era, humanity discovered the Void, mistaking it for the totality of the primal force, unaware it was merely the Storm's shadow. This discovery led to a technological revolution marked by neural dampeners for emotional control, Void-powered infrastructure, and consciousness manipulation technology. The Ancients developed sophisticated systems for emotional regulation, creating a society that valued control and order above all else. Their hubris in attempting to master and suppress the natural forces of creation would ultimately lead to their downfall, as their experiments and manipulations of the fundamental forces of existence triggered the cataclysmic event known as the Shattering."

His transformation into a fundamental force of nature was mirrored by the Veil's own metamorphosis into the embodiment of Void energy. The conflict between these two forces tore reality apart, creating the foundation for modern Storm and Void manipulation.

The Wanderer and the Enchantress, eternal beings from the Ancient past, joined the Sentinels in mentoring this new generation, helping them understand the delicate balance between power and responsibility.

The era became defined by the struggle between the Wills and their apprentices against these dark forces, as both sides sought to prove their vision of balance.

The Wills of the Storm, tempered by loss and battle, now stand as the world's new guardians, carrying forward the wisdom of their fallen mentors while forging their own path. This period is marked by both celebration of victory and remembrance of those lost, as the world begins to heal from the wounds of conflict. The surviving Sentinels, though diminished in number, continue to share their knowledge with the new generation, ensuring that the lessons of the past are not forgotten. It is a time of rebuilding, not just of places and things, but of hope and purpose, as the Wills work to honor the legacy of their predecessors while guiding the world toward a new understanding of balance."
